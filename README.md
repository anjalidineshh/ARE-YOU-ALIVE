# [Are You Alive?] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [snap]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Anjali Dinesh] - [ASIET]
- Member 2: [Aneena Ann George] - [ASIET]

### Project Description
[A quirky web app that asks the user: "Are You Alive?"
If yes, you crack a fortune cookie to receive a random piece of digital wisdom.
If no, you get a fun excuse for your undead situation. It‚Äôs nonsense‚Äîbut interactive nonsense.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People forget to check if they‚Äôre alive. Sometimes, they need a website to confirm it for them‚Äîwith style and snacks.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[A fully-functioning fortune cookie simulator that checks your vital status (sort of), gives you a cookie (virtually), and shares randomized fortunes or excuses based on your answer.
Because if you're not alive, at least have a good reason.]
